# Project Proposal

### Project title

Visuarithm 

### For whom?

Visuarithm is for beginner coding students who may need some extra help understanding basic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort etc.. We know that it's hard to imagine how these algorithms work (because we've been there too!) so Visuarithm is here to help. By showing a visual representation of how these algorithms sort a dataset, while highlighting the parts of its code that the animation corresponds to, students can gain a better grasp of their coding basics. 

### How?

Users see a dataset on one side of the screen while the other contains the code that corresponds to the selected algorithm. The sorting algorithms in Visuarithm include but are not limited to Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and Heap Sort, which users can select from a dropdown menu. With each press of the "play" button, users can see one step of the algorithm's sorting process while the other section of the screen highlights the part of the code that the step corresponds to. Users can use a sample dataset, or enter their own to get a better feel of how the algorithms work on various types of data. 

### Scope

With our extensive knowledge of sorting algorithms as computer science students, we already understand how the sorting algorithms work and will be able to easily showcase it to other students. Our next steps are simply to create the animations for the datasets and the corresponding code for the algorithms.
